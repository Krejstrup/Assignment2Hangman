# Assignment2Hangman
## The Hang the Man game - the comand line version.

This is the second assignment we got for the .Net Core C# crash course.
Made it solo, with not any claims for best solution or best practice.
And embedded with a pinch of sarcasm, so if you are totally not into that
this is a "keep scolling" moment ;)

Please take a look, and I hope you can enjoy it!

**Short about the program:**<br>
It is a standard cmd application, no classes, just a Main() and a handfull of methods.
All the words are placed in a text file so you can have all the different words
you'd like. Even different languages (I think). The words read in from file are internally
changed to upper, so there's no need to worry about that. The words is separated
with linefeed and I havn't tested anything other than that. I don't even reccon that
the Hang the Man game would survive a textfile in any other way...<br>
The game has been tested for several scenarius, but it doesn't imply that it's failproof.
If you'd like you could feedback me with any anoyances that you've discovered.

Q&A:
>Can I play solo with Hang the Man?

Yes you can! The computer will guide you through the game and play with you.

>Can I change the words used?

Yes. Open the *GameWords.txt*, or create it if it's lost. And just put in plain
text. All the words that you would like to use in the game. The words are put into
a growing Array ov strings so I can't really say how many words that you can have.
I beleave a few hundred at least.

>Does i cost anything?

Eh, no. Totally free. Did you have something in mind?

>Who's Krajan?

Well, that's an old nick name for me. That has stuck with me since like 1980.

>Are your eyes really green?

No! They are more like grey-ish - who are you?
